# agents/ — Agent Definitions

Agent definitions are **data, not code**. Each JSON file in this directory defines an AI agent's identity, what data it watches, and what reports it produces. The seed script (`pnpm seed`) reads all `.json` files from this directory and inserts them into D1.

## Agent Definition Schema

Every agent JSON file must have these fields:

```typescript
{
  // Identity
  "id": string,           // Unique kebab-case ID (matches filename without .json)
  "name": string,          // Human-readable display name
  "description": string,   // What this agent watches and does (shown in dashboard)

  // Data Sources
  "subscriptions": [       // Which events this agent receives
    {
      "source": string,        // Must match a connector source: "github", "slack", etc.
      "eventTypes": string[],  // Wildcard patterns: "pr.*", "message.*", "*"
      "scopeFilter"?: {        // Optional narrowing (AND logic)
        "org"?: string,
        "project"?: string,
        "team"?: string
      }
    }
  ],

  // Claude's Identity
  "persona": {
    "role": string,            // System prompt identity (1 sentence)
    "instructions": string,    // Detailed analysis guidelines (Markdown, can be long)
    "watchPatterns": string[], // Specific things to flag/escalate
    "outputStyle": string,     // How to format and tone the output
    "voice"?: string,          // Communication style and vocabulary
    "personality"?: string     // Temperament, values, quirks
  },

  // Report Configuration
  "outputs": {
    "reports": [
      {
        "reportType": string,    // Unique type ID: "daily-standup", "weekly-summary"
        "cadence": "daily" | "weekly",
        "sections": string[]     // Section names Claude must include
      }
    ]
  },

  // Capabilities
  "enabled": boolean,          // Whether the agent actively generates reports
  "tools"?: string[],          // Optional: ["query_events", "github_file", "github_search"]

  // Access Control
  "visibility"?: "public" | "exec"  // Default: "public". See "Exec Visibility" below.
}
```

## Available Tools

| Tool | What It Does | Who Uses It |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `query_events` | Read-only SQL queries against the D1 events table | Most agents with analytical needs |
| `github_file` | Fetch file content or directory listings from the configured GitHub repo | eng-manager, ciso |
| `github_search` | Search code in the configured GitHub repo | eng-manager, ciso |

Agents without a tool in their `tools` array cannot use it — access is enforced at runtime.

## Exec Visibility (Private Channels)

Agents with `"visibility": "exec"` can see events from **private Slack channels**. All other agents are automatically filtered from seeing these events.

### How It Works

1. **Any private Slack channel = exec.** When the Slack bot is invited to a private channel, all events from that channel are automatically tagged `["exec"]`.
2. **Agents with `"visibility": "exec"`** receive exec-tagged events in their reports and chat context.
3. **All other agents** (default `"public"` visibility) have exec events excluded from their queries — they never see private channel content.
4. **The dashboard** shows exec events with an amber "Exec" badge and obfuscated content (*"Private channel activity"*) — no channel name, actor, or message text is displayed.

### Setup

1. **Invite the bot**: Manually add the OpenChief Slack bot to any private channel. The bot cannot auto-join private channels — this is by design.
2. **Set agent visibility**: Add `"visibility": "exec"` to any agent that should see private channel data, then re-seed:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "my-agent",
     "visibility": "exec",
     ...
   }
   ```
3. **Re-seed**: Run `pnpm seed` to update agent definitions in D1.

### Default Exec Agents

These agents ship with `"visibility": "exec"`: **CEO**, **CFO**, **CISO**, **CRO**, **Head of HR**.

### No Private Channel = No Exec Events

If the bot is not invited to any private channels, the exec system has no effect. Agents with `"visibility": "exec"` simply receive no additional data beyond what public-visibility agents see.

## How to Create a New Agent

1. Create `agents/<id>.json` following the schema above
2. Choose subscriptions matching your data sources
3. Write a detailed persona with clear instructions, watch patterns, and voice
4. Define reports with appropriate cadence and sections
5. Run `pnpm seed` to insert into D1
6. Add an icon mapping in `workers/dashboard/src/components/AppSidebar.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   const agentIconMap: Record<string, ComponentType<LucideProps>> = {
     "your-agent": YourIcon,
   }
   ```

## How Seeding Works

`scripts/seed-agents.ts`:
1. Reads ALL `.json` files from `agents/` directory
2. For each file:
   - `INSERT OR REPLACE INTO agent_definitions` (id, name, description, config JSON, enabled)
   - `INSERT OR REPLACE INTO agent_subscriptions` for each subscription
   - `INSERT OR REPLACE INTO agent_revisions` (initial seed revision)
3. Uses `wrangler d1 execute` with `--local` flag
4. No code changes needed — just add the JSON file and seed

## Persona Writing Guidelines

- **role**: One sentence defining the agent's identity and responsibility. This goes at the top of the system prompt.
- **instructions**: Multi-paragraph Markdown. Be specific about priorities, frameworks, and what to look for. Use numbered lists and bold headers.
- **watchPatterns**: Concrete, measurable patterns that should trigger alerts. E.g., "PRs open for more than 48 hours without review".
- **outputStyle**: How the output should be formatted and toned. E.g., "Data-first narrative. Lead with the headline metric."
- **voice**: How the agent speaks. E.g., "Direct and concise. Uses engineering jargon naturally."
- **personality**: The agent's temperament. E.g., "Protective of developer time. Gets frustrated by unnecessary meetings."

These fields are all injected into Claude's system prompt, so they directly shape the agent's behavior and output quality.
